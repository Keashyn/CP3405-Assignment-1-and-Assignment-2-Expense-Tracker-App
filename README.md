## Scrum Report And Presenation on Scrum

This is Group B1 [Scrum Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ljeTd45wb6Sv6PPzmzh9rSooItRPeFx67xR4QZ6773U/edit?usp=sharing) and [Presenation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1pk9e4DdihuqVPYs9wDCbNOHoHGVAg1e8/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=106273584563257056793&rtpof=true&sd=true)

<br />

## To run the app

You would first need to download android studio with this link: https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=CjwKCAjwy7CKBhBMEiwA0Eb7atJ6tre3ZYgZRXF42p2Be1jvKdYEpmaXDTeNtNX57GDOD8oLAwNIsxoCcnwQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds

You need to clone or download the source code from the branch named Clement's_branch. After cloning the source code, open it in android studio and click trust the project. You will also have to download a virtual device using the AVD manager in android studio to run the app. I used the pixel 3XL API 30. This branch has all the screens linked together and also the app works.

Igore the other three branches those are separate for transaction and budget screens.

If you face any issues running the project please contact me on Discord @Senko#1882
